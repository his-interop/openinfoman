# Vagrant for OpenInfoMan

This an in-progress creation of a base box for end-to-end testing of OpenInfoMan using Vagrant and Ansible. It is not complete.

This is copied and modified from the BAO Systems DHIS2-CentOS [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/baosystems/dhis2-centos).

For cleaning up, note that Vagrant boxes are stored in `~/.vagrant.d/boxes`.
